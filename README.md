# Grey Wolf Optimizer and Whale Optimization Algorithm for Reusable Supply Chain

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

In this repository, I have shared my implementation of Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) in SAS for solving the problem of stochastic inventory management of reusable products in a two-level supply chain.

The SQP algorithm is a nonlinear optimization technique that has been proven to be highly effective in solving a wide range of problems. By applying this algorithm to the problem of stochastic inventory management, I have been able to develop a model that can assist businesses in making better inventory management decisions.

This repository includes all of the necessary code and data files for running the SQP algorithm in SAS. Additionally, I have provided detailed documentation and instructions on how to use the code to solve the inventory management problem.

I hope that my work can be of assistance to those who are interested in inventory management or nonlinear optimization techniques. Please feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have.

Additionally, I would like to note that the code in this repository is based on the methodology used in my paper entitled "Grey wolf optimizer and whale optimization algorithm for stochastic inventory management of reusable products in a two-level supply chain", which is published in Journal of IEEE Access. The code provided here was used to generate the results and findings presented in the paper.

I encourage you to take a look at the paper for a deeper understanding of the problem being solved and the methodology used. The paper can be accessed at [HERE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10106258).

Thank you for your interest in our work.
